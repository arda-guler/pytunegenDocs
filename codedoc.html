	<h2>pytunegen.constants</h2>
	<p>
	pytunegen.constants holds... well... constants. You won't need to communicate with this module unless you want to pull off a really 
	crazy trick. It includes:
	<br>
	<br>
	&emsp;
	 - Note pitches
	<br>
	<br>
	&emsp;
	&emsp;
	   All notes from C3 to B5 are present.
	<br>
	&emsp;
	&emsp;
	   Variables representing full notes are written as c3, d3, f3, ..., a4, b4, ... and so on.
	<br>
	&emsp;
	&emsp;
	   Variables representing half notes are written as c_4, f_4, ... and so on. The underscore represents "#", so c_4 is actually C#4.
	<br>
	<br>
	&emsp;
	&emsp;
	   pytunegen.constants.c5 would give you the pitch of the note C5 as an integer, which is 523. (Due to C5's frequency being 523 Hertz.)
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	&emsp;
	 - Scales (dicts that show which notes are used in which scale)
	<br>
	<br>
	&emsp;
	&emsp;
	   In a scale dict, keys are the usual way notes are written, and values are the pitch values of the notes.
	<br>
	&emsp;
	&emsp;
	   For example: a_major = {"C#3":c_3, "D3":d3, "E3":e3, "F#3":f_3, "G#3":g_3, "A3":a3, "B3":b3, ... }
	<br>
	&emsp;
	&emsp;
	   Following scales are available: c_major, d_major, e_major, f_major, g_major, a_major, b_major, c_minor, d_minor, e_minor, f_minor, g_minor, a_minor, b_minor
	<br>
	<br>
	&emsp;
	&emsp;
	   "full_notes" is a dict (or a special scale) that includes all notes.
	<br>
	<br>
	&emsp;
	&emsp;
	   "scales" is a dict that holds all scales + full_notes. You will probably want to use this to get a scale.
	<br>
	&emsp;
	&emsp;
	   (pytunegen.constants.scales.get("F Minor") gets you the f_minor dict)
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	&emsp;
	 - Preset bpm values (the script randomly chooses among presets if the user does not provide a custom bpm)
	<br>
	&emsp;
	&emsp;
	   bpm_slowest, bpm_slow, bpm_slowish, bpm_normal, bpm_fastish, bpm_fast, bpm_fastest
	<br>
	<br>
	&emsp;
	&emsp;
	   There is also a list of all preset bpms, called "bpms".
	<br>
	&emsp;
	&emsp;
	   bpms = [bpm_slow, bpm_slowish ... ]
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	&emsp;
	 - Note durations
	<br>
	<br>
	&emsp;
	&emsp;
	   There is a dict that holds possible note durations from 1/8 to 4.
	<br>
	&emsp;
	&emsp;
	   note_durations = {"1/8": 1/8, "1/4":1/4, "1/2": 1/2, "1":1, "2":2, "4":4}
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	&emsp;
	 - Bar repeats
	<br>
	<br>
	&emsp;
	&emsp;
	   A list holds possible times a bar can repeat.
	<br>
	&emsp;
	&emsp;
	   bar_repeats = [2, 4]
	<br>

	<h2>pytunegen.tunegen</h2>
	<p>
	This is where the actual music generation happens.
	<br>
	<br>
	&emsp;
	 - class Tunegen(seed = None, music_length = 50,
                 scale = None, bpm = None, time_sig = None,

	<br>
	&emsp;
